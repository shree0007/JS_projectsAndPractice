# JAVASCRIPT OBJECTS AND CLASSES

## OOP (Object oriented Programming)
- Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm/style/approach that is based on the concept of "objects."
- The key principles of object-oriented programming include:

Object: An instance of a class with its own state (data) and behavior (methods).

Class: A blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the properties and methods that objects of the class will have.

Abstraction: Abstraction is the concept of simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on the essential properties and behaviors relevant to the problem, while ignoring or hiding unnecessary details.

Encapsulation: The bundling of data and methods that operate on the data within a single unit (object). It protects the internal state of an object.

Inheritance: The ability of a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class. It supports code reuse and the creation of a hierarchy of classes.

Polymorphism: The ability to use a single interface to represent different types of objects. It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class.



## Object
- Collection of properties and methods

## Class
- In object-oriented programming, a class is often described as a blueprint or a template for creating objects
